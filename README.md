# Eye-Disease-Detection-VGG16-Transfer-Learning
Casual ML project flex – baseline vs remix with VGG16 — vibes only.

📝 About
This repo includes two Jupyter notebooks where I mess around with VGG16 for eye disease detection:

Original Architecture: Classic VGG16 + custom head.

Modified Architecture: Extra layers and tweaks for that extra drip.

All done with transfer learning, so we’re glamming up a pre-trained model.

📁 Notebooks
original_architecture.ipynb – OG VGG16 setup.

modified_VGG16.ipynb – Remix version with enhancements.

🧠 Dataset
Using the Eye Disease Detection Dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ysnreddy/eye-disease-detection-dataset
I trained on 100 images per class to keep it chill and consistent.

🚀 Features
Step-by-step code for loading, augmenting, and training.

Transfer learning: freeze/unfreeze layers.

Head customizations and extra layers.

Model evaluation with accuracy/loss plots & metrics.

💻 How to Run
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Open in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.

Replace dataset paths as needed.

Run the cells, let it train on 100 images/class, and enjoy.

🧙‍♂️ Requirements
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit‑learn, etc.
(See pip install list in the notebooks)

🖼️ Results
Training/validation metrics visualized.

Confusion matrix and classification report included.
